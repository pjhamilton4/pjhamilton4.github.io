  authorDescription: `<strong>Software Developer // Tinkerer </strong> <br /> <br /> 

    I have been a professional developer since 2011 and have been building computers and coding since early 2007. <br /><br />

    After graduating college in 2011 I started working for Macy's Inc. as a Software Developer
    writing enterprise warehousing management software in the Executive Development Program. <br />

    Over 8 years I worked my way up to be a Lead Software Developer for Warehouse Management Systems at Macy's Inc. <br /><br />
    
    In 2019, I decided to move back to my home state of Virginia! <br /><br />
    I currently work as a freelance developer and mostly work with Full Stack Development in Java and JavaScript. I'm always open to new opportunities!`,
